        <h2> HTML5</h2>
        <p> HTML5, the fifth and latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language,
            has revolutionized the way web content is created and experienced. Introduced
            with a focus on delivering rich multimedia experiences without the need for third-party
            plugins, HTML5 brings a host of new elements and attributes that enhance the structure
            and functionality of web pages. One of its key features is the native support for audio
            and video, allowing developers to embed media directly into their documents. HTML5
            also introduces semantic elements like header, nav, footer
            providing a more meaningful structure to web content. This facilitates improved
            accessibility and search engine optimization. Additionally, HTML5 supports offline
            web applications through the use of the Application Cache, enabling users to interact
            with content even when not connected to the internet. The introduction of the Canvas
            element enables dynamic graphics and animations, making HTML5 a versatile and powerful
            tool for building modern, interactive web applications across various platforms and
            devices.</p>
        <h2>CSS3</h2>
        <p>
            CSS3, the third iteration of Cascading Style Sheets, revolutionizes
            web design by introducing a plethora of new features and enhancements.
            With a primary focus on making websites more visually appealing and responsive,
            CSS3 provides tools for creating flexible and dynamic layouts. The introduction
            of media queries facilitates the development of responsive designs, ensuring
            seamless user experiences across various devices. The Flexbox and Grid Layout
            models offer developers powerful options for organizing and aligning elements
            within a webpage. CSS3 also brings transitions and animations directly into
            stylesheets, allowing for smoother and more engaging user interfaces without
            the need for external plugins or extensive JavaScript. Custom fonts, box shadows,
            border radius, gradient backgrounds, and multiple backgrounds contribute to the
            toolkit, offering designers greater flexibility and creative freedom. With CSS3,
            web developers can elevate the aesthetics and functionality of their projects,
            making it an indispensable technology in modern web design.

        <h2>JS</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that follows the ECMAScript standard. It was originally
            designed as a scripting language for websites but became widely adopted as a general-purpose programming
            language, and is currently the most popular programming language in use.[1] JavaScript is usually found
            running in a web browser as interactive or automated content, ranging from popup messages and live clocks to
            large web applications. JavaScript is also commonly used in server-side programming through platforms like
            Node.js,[2] or "embedded" in non-JavaScript applications where the base programming language lacks the
            high-level functionality that JavaScript offers.

            Despite the similarities in name and syntax, JavaScript is not related to the programming language Java.
            Though the names of both languages are trademarks of Oracle Corporation, the two languages follow different
            design principles, and are actively developed by unrelated organizations.</p>
